It would help if the authors would explain the code in more detail.However, the basics of producing good quality programs were covered well, but the architecture of Windows and event-driven programming were not covered in good detail.  I strongly believe that understanding the code is just as important as producing a program that incorporates a good user interface and that provides rich functionality.That brings me to my third point: the book concentrates too much on producing the program GUI and not enough on data handling and the refined Input-Output functions of the new MFC.  The book does not go into enough detail about the data control in a program and object hierarchies of the MFC.Overall, this book was a good introduction, but any expectations beyond that were not satisfied with the reading of this book\", \"overall\": 2.0, \"reviewTime\": \"08 25, 1997\"}',\n",

Myra Lester, a ballet dancer (Vivien Leigh)  and Roy Cronin, a military captain (Robert Taylor) have a chance meeting on Waterloo Bridge  during an air raid, and it is &quot;love at first sight.&quot; They attempt to get married but it is not to be, for Roy is called away before they can. Myra and her friend Kitty are kicked out of ballet class and are forced to fend for themselves. Believing Roy to be dead, and being destitute, Myra turns to prostitution. However, he returns from the war, alive after all, and takes Myra to his country home in Scotland, where the couple is soon to be wed. But Myra, not wanting to dishonor Roy, finds that she cannot marry him. She returns to London and there, at Waterloo Bridge, kills  herself. However, Roy, dicovering what she\\'d been hiding from him but moments too late, vows  to always love her and never forget her.Although this movie ends tragically, it is definitely not one to be missed. The storyline is well thought out and the acting superb. The main characters are also well-defined. Myra is a sweet,  lovable girl whom demands your compassion, while Roy is the perfect man--sensitive, handsome,  and rich. ;^) From the very beginning you become entangled in the lives of the two people and the  undying love they have for one another.Although lesser known then some, Waterloo Bridge is a classic. It shows how war can devastatingly change the lives of ordinary people and depicts true love and honor in every respect.END\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"reviewTime\": \"09 20, 1997\"}',\n",
